## Aircrack-ng
- Network sofrware used for security testing of wireless lan's
- It works with any wireless network interface controller whose driver supports raw monitoring mode 
- The aircrack-ng software suite includes:

  Name 	           Description
aircrack-ng 	  Cracks WEP keys using the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir (FMS) attack, PTW, Korek, dictionary attacks, and WPA/WPA2-PSK using dictionary attacks.
airdecap-ng   	Decrypts WEP or WPA encrypted capture files with known key.
airmon-ng 	    Places different cards in monitor mode.
aireplay-ng 	  Packet injector (Linux, and Windows with CommView drivers).
airodump-ng 	  Packet sniffer: Places air traffic into pcap or IVS files and shows information about networks.
airtun-ng 	    Virtual tunnel interface creator.
packetforge-ng 	Creates encrypted packets for injection.
ivstools 	      Tools to merge and convert.
airbase-ng 	    Incorporates techniques for attacking client, as opposed to Access Points.
airdecloak-ng 	Removes WEP cloaking from pcap files.
airolib-ng 	    Stores and manages ESSID and password lists and compute Pairwise Master Keys.
airserv-ng 	    Allows to access the wireless card from other computers.
buddy-ng 	      The helper server for easside-ng, run on a remote computer.
easside-ng 	    A tool for communicating to an access point, without the WEP key.
tkiptun-ng 	    WPA/TKIP attack tool.
wesside-ng 	    Automatic tool for WEP key recovery.

## Using Aircrack-ng to Capture 4-way Handshake
- The 4-way handshake is the process of exchanging 4 messages between an access point (authenticator) and the client device (supplicant) 
  to generate some encryption keys which can be used to encrypt actual data sent over Wireless medium.
